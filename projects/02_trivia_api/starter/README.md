# Full Stack API Final Project


## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/FSND/blob/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter) and [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your machine.

Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.


### Backend

The [./backend](https://github.com/Mostafa-Farghly/FSND/blob/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter/backend/README.md) directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server. The API endpoints are implemented in `flaskr/__init__.py` and are tested by the tests in `test_flaskr.py`. You can find the API reference in the [./backend/README.md](https://github.com/Mostafa-Farghly/FSND/blob/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter/backend/README.md).

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
