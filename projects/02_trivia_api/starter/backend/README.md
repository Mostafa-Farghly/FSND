# Backend - Full Stack Trivia API 

### Installing Dependencies for the Backend

1. **Python 3.8** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)


2. **Virtual Enviornment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)


3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.


4. **Key Dependencies**
 - [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

 - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

 - [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

### Database Setup

#### Step 0: Start/Stop the PostgreSQL server
Mac users can follow the commands below:
```bash
which postgres
postgres --version
# Start/stop
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop 
```
Windows users can follow the commands below:
- Find the database directory, it should be something like that: *C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13.2\data*
- Then, in the command line, execute the folllowing command: 
```bash
# Start the server
pg_ctl -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13.2\data" start
# Stop the server
pg_ctl -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13.2\data" stop
```
If it shows that the *port already occupied* error, run:
```bash
sudo su - 
ps -ef | grep postmaster | awk '{print $2}'
kill <PID> 
```

#### Step 1 - Create and Populate the database
1. **Verify the database username**<br>
Verify that the database user in the `/backend/trivia.psql`, `/backend/models.py`, and `/backend/test_flaskr.py` files must be either the `<user>` or `postgres` (default username).

2. **Create the database and a user**<br>
In your terminal, run the following to create two databases:
```bash
# Create database used in development
createdb trivia
#create database used in testing
createdb trivia_test
```

3. **Create tables**<br>
Once your databases are created, you can create tables (`questions`, `categories`) and apply contraints
```bash
# Mac users
psql -f trivia.psql -U <user> -d trivia
psql -f trivia.psql -U <user> -d trivia_test
# Linux users
su - postgres bash -c "psql trivia < /path/to/exercise/backend/trivia.psql"
su - postgres bash -c "psql trivia_test < /path/to/exercise/backend/trivia.psql"

```

### Running the server

From within the `./backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

## API Refrence

### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys. 

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```js
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable

### Endpoints
